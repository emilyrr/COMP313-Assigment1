## Description

### Main mechanic
Stuff about the main action in the game

### Development difficulties
Getting the AI to want to take over the world was challenging as the return on investment is low.

### Most interesting
The parts of the game that really shine and show off my programming ability

### Reflection on Learning
What was the most important this I learnt in the process.  One way to frame this is to look at things you struggled with and think about how you solved those and if that solution is **transferable** to similar situations.

Reflections can be at multiple levels.  Specific things that you learnt about the code, things you learnt about programming in the environment, things about programming in general, things about learning, or even things about how you value different aspects of your life. We expect you to cover the general programming and learning reflections based on specific examples but showing that you have generalised from those a more interesting lesson.

You need to edit this readme to discuss your project. .  If you are doing a technology then you need to change the header above.  Edit <your name> to be something like Simon McCallum
